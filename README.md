# MechanicShop – Workshop Management System

### Full-Stack Showcase Project | ASP.NET Core | Blazor WebAssembly | Clean Architecture

MechanicShop is a workshop management system developed as a full-stack **showcase project** to demonstrate modern backend architecture, clean design principles, and real-time communication in a business-oriented domain.

The project focuses on building a scalable, maintainable, and well-structured system for managing automotive repair workflows while applying industry best practices.

---

## Architecture Overview

MechanicShop follows **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles to ensure clear separation of concerns, testability, and long-term maintainability.

### Architectural Patterns Used
- Clean Architecture (Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- CQRS-style separation for commands and queries
- Real-time communication using SignalR
- Modular, microservices-ready structure

---

## Core Features

### Workflow and Operations
- Work order creation and lifecycle management  
- Task and repair workflow orchestration  
- Real-time status updates using SignalR  
- Workshop capacity and repair spot management  
- Technician workload and assignment tracking  

### Billing and Finance
- Extensible billing and invoicing design  
- Discount, tax, and pricing rule support  
- Repair cost calculation and tracking  

### Business Management
- Parts inventory and availability tracking  
- Supplier and pricing management  
- Structured audit logging
